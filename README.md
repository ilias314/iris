## ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classification Project

This is my first machine learning mini-project using the Iris dataset.
The goal is to build a model that can classify Iris flowers into three species based on their measurements.

The project includes:

* Loading and exploring the Iris dataset
* Splitting data into training and validation sets
* Training simple ML models
* Evaluating model performance

All steps are documented inside the Jupyter Notebook.
